                        An algorithm is defined a set or rules or instructions.
                        In computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of instructions that a computer executes to perform a specific function.
                        Algorithms can come in many different forms and complete many different tasks,
                        from simple arithmetic to complex pathfinding, as long as a set of instructions is followed,
                        it can be considered an algorithm.

                                The quicksort algorithm is a fast sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n * log(n)).
                                The algorithm works by choosing a partitions, then comparing the elements within that array to the partition. 
                                If the chosen element is greater than the partition, place it to the right, if the element is smaller, place it to the left.
                                With the smaller two unsorted sub arrays, repeat the steps above until the remaining sub arrays are of length 1.

                                Breadth first search is traversal algorithm allowing for the ability search through a given tree or graph.
                                The algorithm searches layer by layer, traversing to a different depth at every step.
                                Starting at an origin node, the algorithm checks all of that nodes neighbors.
                                These new nodes's neighbors are then checked by the algorithm. This process continues until, all the nodes of a given graph or tree are checked.
                                BFS is useful for finding the distance between two nodes in an unweighted directed or undirected graph.

                            <p class="info_paragraph">
                                The binary search algorithm is an efficient way to search for a target value within a sorted list.
                                To find a target item using this algorithm, you first select the center item of your sorted list as the value node to compare.
                                Then you compare this item with your target, if your target is greater than the value node, the remaining to the right of the value node becomes the next sub array to check.
                                Otherwise, the next sub array to check is left of the target.
                                These steps are repeated with the remaining sub arrays until the target is found.

                                Given a 2d array of bacteria "*", find the number of colonies and return their size and the top left most point.
                                This problem consists of two steps, finding colonies, then finding their size.
                                We can find the top left corner of colonies by starting at (0, 0) and searching leftwards then downwards.
                                If a colony is found, we can use BFS to find its size and track their occupied spaces.

                                Given a starting word, ending word, and list of valid words.
                                Find the minimum number of letter changes to valid words required to reach the target word.
                                If no word is found, output 0.
                                This problem uses BFS to search through a graph of nodes, where the value of a node is a word,
                                and its edges are possible transformations.
                                We can create a dictionary of the valid words possible states, and store the unmodified possible values at its value.
                                We can use a placeholder letter value "*" to track changed words and compare it with our new modified words.
                                Then we can check all modifications of the previous words possible values.

                                Locate the target item in a sorted array in O(log(n)) time. This question involves implementing a simple binary search.

                                Here we can use binary search to find the optimal number of days required to ship every weight.
                                First starting at the middle of the sum of every weight, and the weight of the largest element,
                                we can check through every weight tracking the number of days required to ship with this maximum weight.
                                If the number of days is to great, we can increase the maximum weight capacity.
                                If the number of days is to little, we can decrease the maximum weight capacity.

                                To solve this problem, we can create a duplicate array of sorted numbers.
                                Then we can loop through the original array and use binary search to find the location of each item within the sorted array.
                                The index of this item, is then the number of smaller elements.
                                We can then remove this element from the sorted array to prevent future searches from adding elements before itself.
