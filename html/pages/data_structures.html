                    A data structure is a specialized format for storing information.
                    Different types of data structures exist and they have different purposes.
                    The main purpose of data structures is that they specialize in an area, whether it is retrieval of information,
                    inserting information, removal of objects, having objects sorted, or even having a quick method to check if the object is even there or not.
                    Below are some examples of multiple basic data structures shown along with their applications.

                    <p class="info_paragraph">
                        An array is a collection of data of similar type stored at contiguous memory locations.
                        Each item in the array can be accessed using an index number.
                        When initialized, a fixed size must be specified.
                        The size of an array can no longer be changed after being initialized
                        In most languages, the index of an array starts at 0.
                        This means the first item in an array has an index of 0.

                    <p class="info_paragraph">
                        An ArrayList is a dynamically resizing array that does not have a set size.
                        Items can freely be added and removed. 
                        Because of this, an ArrayList will take up more memory than an array and will be slower to operate on.

                    <p class="info_paragraph">
                        A Map is a collection of data stored in key value pairs, where data is accessed using its associated key.
                        A Map cannot have duplicate keys but can store a variety of data types including classes and other data structures.
                        Maps are useful for quickly searching for items since they can be accessed using their key with an <strong>average</strong> time complexity of O(1).

                    <p class="info_paragraph">
                        A Graphs is a complex data structure represents nodes of data linked to each other.
                        These links are called edges and can be directed or undirected. <br> <br>
                        An undirected edge has no direction. This means the two nodes it links point to each other.
                        For example, the graph A - B has an undirected edge between nodes A and B.
                        This means Node a is connected to Node B and Node B is connected to node A. <br> <br>
                        An directed edge however has a direction. This means only one node points to the other.
                        For example, the graph C -> D has a directed edge between Nodes C and D.
                        This means Node C is connected to node D but Node D is <strong>NOT</strong> connected to node C.

                                Given a non empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one.

                                We can use an array to store our numbers.
                                Looping through the array, if a number is in our storage array, remove it. Otherwise add it to the array.
                                Since duplicate items appear twice, they will be added and later removed leaving the one remaining non duplicate integer.

                                Given an integer array of coins, assuming you have infinite of each coin, return the minimum number of coins required to reach the target value.
                                If no combination of coins reaches the target, return -1.
                                We can use an array of length (target + 1) to represent of number of coins setting each value to an unreachable number.
                                The index of this array represents a target, and its value represents the number of coins required to get there.
                                We first set the 0th index to a value of 0 since it takes 0 coins to reach a value of 0.
                                Then we can loop through the array and every type of coin.
                                At each index, we can add the coin value to the index 
                                and set the value of this index to the min of (value of our current index + 1, the previous stored value).
                                For example [index 0 + coin value of 5] = min([index 0 + coin value of 5], [index 0] + 1).
                                This would give us the minimum number of coins required to reach that index.
                                We then return the value of the last index if it is not an unreachable value.
                                Otherwise we return -1

                                You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array
                                nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.
                                If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of
                                bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.
                                Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.
                                <br><br>
                                We can find the maximum number of possible coins by choosing a balloon in our array as the last balloon to pop.
                                This means that our maximum number of coins is the sum of the coins from adjacent sub arrays to the left and right of the selected balloon plus the value of the selected balloon.
                                Each of these sub arrays values can be found by choosing a balloon to act as the last balloon popped and summing the values of the adjacent sub arrays.
                                The result of each of these sub arrays can be stored in a 2d array where the first index if the start index of the sub array and the second index is the ending index of the sub array.
                                Each time we encounter a sub array, if the value has already been calculated, we can used the stored value instead of recalculating the result.
                                Then we can return the max number of coins.

                                To solve this problem, we can create a map.
                                Every time we encounter a number, if the item exists in the map, return True, otherwise add the number to the map.

                                We can use two maps to store the count of every letter in the two strings.
                                Set a character to the key and add one to the value every time the letter is encountered.
                                If the two maps are identical after scanning both strings, then the two words must be anagrams.

                                We can use a map to store the index of each encountered character and use a variable to store the maximum length and the index of the last repeated character.
                                If we encounter a character after the start index we set the new starting index to the past character's index.
                                Otherwise we update the max string length by finding the distance between the current index and the start index.
